### Description

SORRY ABOUT MISSING .DLL. Copy Dll to Windows System.

This Application can be used for a Bookmark for a

Web browser or a Shell application for a File manager.

Add the categories eg (Utilities, Graphics etc).

Then add the Applications to the Categories. (Name

and Fullpath of Application). If the File cannot be found

a msgbox will let the User know. Dbl_Click on an

Application and it will be executed. Everything is

saved to a single File and reloaded into the Treeview

when Loaded. This .dll is part of a Advanced File Manager

that i`m writing. thats why it contains quite a few functions.
